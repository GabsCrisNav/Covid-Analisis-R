# Deep analysis for SARS-CoV-2 ⛑️

The disease called COVID-19 is a highly contagious viral infection,
the cause of this severe acute respiratory syndrome is SARS-CoV-2.
The analyzes that were carried out on SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated that it is phylogenetically
with viruses that affect bats. A vaccine against this virus has already been developed since
it belongs to the family of coronaviruses, which made it possible to develop the vaccine with a fairly high speed.

This script does:

● Work with coronavirus sequences from other species similar to SARS-CoV-2, through fasta files

● Analyze the duration of the sequences

● Analyze the concentrations of the different nucleotides

● Display information in clear, colorful graphics
